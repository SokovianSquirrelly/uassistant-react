  "description": "As part of my education at Brigham Young University-Idaho, I took upon myself this project, which is meant to be a web application for use in drug testing. While attending school, I took on a few different jobs, one of which took place at the Jefferson County Probation Department in Rigby, Idaho. As part of my job, I would perform a UA test to several individuals for various controlled and illicit substances, ranging from prescription medications that are prone to abuse (such as morphine or amphetamines), to dangerous, illegal substances like cocaine or methamphetamine.",
